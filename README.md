Glazing and Winter Comfort Tool
========================================
This tool displays the impact of glazing geometry and U-value on occupant thermal comfort during winter months. It shows when it is possible to eliminate perimeter heat in cases where the glazing is ratio is small enough and U-Value is low enough to ensure warm interior glass temperature and thermally comfortable occupants.

More specifically, it quantifies thermal discomfort from both overall mean radiant heat loss to the cold glass as well as cold downdraft from the glass, which can cause local discomfort

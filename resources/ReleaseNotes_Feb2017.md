RELEASE NOTES
========================================
**1) New Model for Downdraft Discomfort** – Using the findings from a recent study conducted by Schavion et al (2016), we have replaced the old model for downdraft discomfort with a new one that more precisely targets cold discomfort at foot level.  The previous model, which was derived several decades ago from tests where cold air was blown on the back of subject’s necks, has been shown to overestimate the foot-level occupant dissatisfaction in a number of cases. The new model computes occupant dissatisfaction from ankle draft (PPDAD) using the downdraft air speed and the full-body occupant thermal sensation of the subject (PMV).  The explanation for the use of PMV as an input is that occupants are more likely to feel discomfort at foot level if their full-bodies are already feeling cold.  More information on the experimental derivation of the model can be found in Schavion et al ‘s paper.  Schavion et all have submitted the model for review by the ASHRAE committee to be incorporated into the ASHRAE-55 thermal comfort standard.  If all goes smoothly, we can expect the new model to be officially incorporated into the standard within the next few years.

**2)	Choose Between Slipt (Two Charts) and Combined (One Chart) for Results Display** – In accordance with the new proposed model for ASHRAE-55, there will now be two separate PPD thresholds that define what is acceptable for full-body radiant discomfort and local ankle draft discomfort.  Specifically, the current proposal states that no more than 20% of occupants should experience ankle draft discomfort, which is distinct from the 10% threshold for full-body discomfort that is recommended for most regularly-occupied spaces.  To accommodate this difference, the Glazing and Winter Comfort Tool now has two charts to display results – one for downdraft discomfort and one for full-body radiant discomfort.  Acceptable comfort thresholds are set separately on each chart.

**3)	CSV Download Button** – After multiple requests for access to more data behind the scenes, we have added a button that allows you to download a excel file (CSV) of the results from the tool.  The CSV includes several parameters that are not present in the primary interface, like the glazing view factor, MRT, and downdraft air speed.

**4)	Feedback Now Given Through Github** – In order to promote more dialogue between us (the developers) and you, we have switched from accepting feedback through our previously limited survey to our new github. Github is an online platform that enables developers and users to share and coordinate software development. By posting an issue on our github, you can request features and report bugs on a forum where other users/developers can easily see and respond.
